FOR 3.1 
I had to add this for services:
services.AddMvc(options => options.EnableEndpointRouting = false);
i guess because i have 3.1




ASP.NET
- MVC Framework
  - Models
  - Views
  - Controllers

- Routing handled in controller

dotnet new web --no-https -o ProjectName
	- web vs console
	- no-https --> ssl certs
	
DEVELOPER TOOLING
Point out Configure method in Startup.cs

Command Line:
	setx ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT Development

PowerShell:
	[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT","Development","User")

Mac:
	export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development


explain dotnet watch run vs dotnet run

Need to add MVC for use in ConfigureServices
	services.AddMVC();

Then Use MVC in Configure
	app.UseMVC();

Setting up Controller
- Controller Folder
  - Controller File

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
namespace YourNamespace.Controllers     //be sure to use your own project's namespace!
{
    public class HelloController : Controller   //remember inheritance??
    {
        //for each route this controller is to handle:
        [HttpGet]       //type of request
        [Route("")]     //associated route string (exclude the leading /)
        public string Index()
        {
            return "Hello World from HelloController!";
        }
    }
}

Routing:
[HttpMethod("route")]

With parameters!
[HttpMethod("route/{parameter}")]
